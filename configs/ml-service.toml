# configs/ml-service.toml
#
# Configuration for the FastAPI ML authenticity verification service.
# The current Python code (`src/config.py`) reads `ML_SERVICE_MODEL_ROOT`
# from the environment for the model directory and otherwise uses
# hard-coded host/port (0.0.0.0:8080 via uvicorn).
#
# You can hook this file into a future Pydantic settings class if desired.

[server]
# Host and port for the FastAPI app.
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080

[models]
# Root directory where model artefacts are stored inside the container.
# Each model is expected at: <model_root>/<aid_hex>.pt
root = "/app/ml_service/models"
